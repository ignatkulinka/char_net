# char_net

**Info**

char_net is a final project for PIC 16 at UCLA. 
This project aims to extract the names of characters from .txt novels
 using the [Stanford NER Tagger](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html).
 The repository has examples of the networks produced for _Frankenstein_, 
 _The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes_, and _Harry Potter 7 - Deathly Hollows_
 
**Usage**

The project was designed to be reused as a module within Python. This can be 
done by importing the `FinalNLTKProj.py` file. The `testNLTKmodule.py` is 
a documented example of how to use the project.
